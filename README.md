# Poco-Loco
A collection of bite-sized, creative PICO-8 games made during Hack Club's summer challenge to explore retro game development, pixel art, and Lua programming. Each game is a unique experienceâ€”some are arcade-style, others experimental. The goal is to complete 500 hours of learning and development through fun, iterative game creation.
