# ðŸŽ® PICO-LOCO

**PICO-LOCO** is a series of creative micro-games made using [PICO-8 Education Edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/), a browser-based fantasy console that teaches retro-style game development with Lua. Built as part of a 500-hour coding challenge, this project explores game mechanics, pixel art, and fun through minimalistic design.

## ðŸ§  Goal

- Make multiple original games using PICO-8
- Learn Lua programming by making real games
- Gain hands-on experience in game design, animation, and sound
- Share games and learn from community feedback
- Have fun creating and playing!
- Steal a Framework Laptop ðŸ‘€

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- [PICO-8 Education Edition](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/)
- Lua (language used in PICO-8)
- Zed (text editor)
- Git (version control)


## ðŸ§  AI Involvement

Some parts of the game design process (like brainstorming ideas, debugging code, or formatting this README) were supported by AI tools like ChatGPT. All gameplay logic was written and tested manually.

## ðŸ“… Project Timeline

- **June â€“ August 2025**: Targeting 500 hours of creative development
- Expect regular releases and updates!
